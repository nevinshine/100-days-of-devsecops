# Day 14: Research Environment Stabilization

## Objective
Stabilize the research environment to support reproducible syscall anomaly experiments.

## Work Done
- Migrated from VM to native Ubuntu 22.04
- Set up CPU-only ML stack (no CUDA dependency)
- Rebuilt Sentinel Sandbox pipeline
- Fixed feature dimension mismatches
- Validated end-to-end experiment flow

## Key Insight
A stable environment is more important than adding features during research.

## Status
Completed
